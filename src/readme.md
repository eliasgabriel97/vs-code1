"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and
 praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system
, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the ma
ster-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasur
e itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pur
sue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful.
 Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of i
 tself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur i
 n which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, exc
 ept to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequ
 ences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"
